## Bayesian Inference

[**predictive_dist.m**](predictive_dist.m)

Things to try:

- Increase the number of observations. Observe that the variance of the predictive
  distribution will generally decrease.

[**nonlinear_bayesian.m**](nonlinear_bayesian.m)

Things to try:

- Use a regression function with 2 or more weights (e.g., initial angle and speed)
- Use many observations. Observe that this will make this simple sampling method
  very expensive.

[**mcmc.m**](mcmc.m)


Things to try:

- Experiment with different proposal distributions
- Use MCMC to sample from the posterior distribution in the nonlinear Bayesian example
